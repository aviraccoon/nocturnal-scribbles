To cook dinner I need groceries. To get groceries I need to have planned ahead. To plan ahead I need to not be panicking about what to eat right now. I'm panicking about what to eat right now. I open the delivery app.

This is how most evenings go. Not all of them. Some nights everything clicks and I'm building things until 4am. But most nights, the chain breaks somewhere before the first step and I end up at my desk not doing the dishes.

I've tracked myself for years. I know my patterns. I brush my teeth in the evening about one night in seven. Cooking, basically never. I clean my desk once or twice a year, when I physically can't put my laptop down anymore. Walking the dog is the one reliable thing, because she needs it and she's looking at me.[^dog]

During this same period I organized 160 games from 72 developers into what Valve later called [their largest multi-game sale event](https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/497186807117513037), nearly solo.[^gamesweek] I [built a procedural music generator](/posts/how-insane-can-i-make-this/) in three sleepless nights. 154 commits in seven weeks at work. I'm not bad at doing things. I'm bad at doing things when I decide to do them.

The gap isn't between wanting and doing. I want to do the dishes. I decided to do the dishes. The gap is somewhere between the decision and it actually happening. And knowing about the gap doesn't close it. I have the data. The data doesn't help.[^flip]

I've [written about this before](/posts/activation-energy/). People nod. They say it sounds hard. They're imagining something different from what it is.

# Skill Issue

So I [made a game about it](https://skill-issue.raccoon.land).

It looks like a productivity app. You see your tasks for the week, pick one, hit Attempt. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't. No error message. The button just didn't do anything.

Time of day affects your chances. Late nights are better, because of course they are. Momentum matters: good days build on each other, bad days spiral. Some tasks are just harder than others. None of this is visible. You figure out your patterns by playing, same as life.[^rates]

There's a dog. The dog always loves you. There's a friend who texts when you're struggling. There's a phone you can check when nothing else is working. Sometimes it's fine. Sometimes it eats your whole evening.

You can't really lose. You can have a rough week. Delivery counts. The minimal version of a task counts. The game doesn't judge you for struggling. It just plays back what happened.

The title is the diagnosis.[^title]

[^dog]: External accountability is the cheat code. Someone else needs something from you and suddenly the executive function works. For the dog, anyway. For the dishes, there's no one watching.
[^flip]: The flip side: when something catches (curiosity, frustration, the 2am spark) I can't stop. Three sleepless nights building a music generator nobody asked for. The energy isn't missing. It just doesn't go where I point it.
[^rates]: The base rates come from real behavioral data. I'm not going to say which numbers are autobiographical.
[^gamesweek]: Czech & Slovak Games Week. My idea, my execution. By the time Valve wrote about it, I'd moved on. It's still running.
[^title]: After 10.5 months of assessment.
