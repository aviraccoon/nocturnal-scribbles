# Hi, I'm Avi

I'm a 33-year-old raccoon living in Prague. I live alone with my dog Matynka, who's basically my executive function support animal. I use they/them pronouns and go by `aviraccoon` online.

I'm nonbinary, a furry, therian,[^1] and have untreated ADHD (attempts at getting diagnosed were made, the system failed me). I care about equal rights, protecting workers, and not accepting bullshit from people around me.

# What I do

I've been in game dev for over 13 years, starting at 19. Currently a Senior Platform Engineer at [GameDiscoverCo](https://gamediscover.co/), fighting with React, TypeScript and Go to make gaming data visible. Before that, I spent years at SCS Software working on Euro Truck Simulator 2 - during which I created the Czech & Slovak Games Week, now [the largest multi-game non-Valve Steam event](https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/497186807117513037).

My background is a weird mix of programming, marketing, community management, and production. Recruiters get confused. I stopped caring.

# How I work

I've always worked alone - on projects, on systems, often in life. These days I use LLMs as an execution layer, which fits that pattern naturally. I architect and direct, AI handles the implementation friction that used to stop solo projects. It's not replacing collaboration I never had, it's a tool that makes programming fun again.

I build things when the annoyance level reaches "fuck it" - that's how this blog generator happened, that's how my custom task system happened. Pain-driven development.

# ADHD & systems

A lot of what I write about comes from trying to figure out how to make my brain work. I've been journaling for years, now I dump everything into an Obsidian vault and process it (with a lot of automation and LLM help). Systems that work with ADHD instead of against it.

The "nocturnal scribbles" part is literal - I do my best work between 10pm and 4am. My git commits prove it.

# Other things I care about

- **Transit safety systems**: Current special interest. Ask me about Prague metro.
- **Self-hosting**: I want to own my data and understand how things work.
- **Data visualization**: How information becomes visible and understandable.
- **Travel**: I try to get out of Prague every few months. Berlin, Budapest, Netherlands, wherever.

# This blog

Custom static site generator, built in one night with Bun and TypeScript. No frameworks, no tracking, no analytics, no bullshit. Just markdown files in git that become HTML.
